== Harry Potter Quarkus Demo
The main goal of this demo is to showcase how to use Infinispan client with Quarkus.

*Infinispan* features that are being used:

* Create stores dynamically
* Simple get/put operations
* Full-text query
* Continuous query

*Quarkus* features:

* REST web-service
* Web Socket
* Task Scheduling
* Application properties
* Application lifecycle events listeners

The demo is composed by two applications that run independently:

* Hogwarts monitoring
* Wizards magic

Each application has a dedicated section in this documentation

== Before running the demo
Quarkus uses http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#client_server[Infinispan Remote Client].
You need to have an Infinispan Server running before you run this demo.

=== Option 1: Use Docker
   docker run -it -p 11222:11222 jboss/infinispan-server:latest

IMPORTANT: *Docker for mac users*. There is a known issue to connect with the server using the hotrod client.
Blog post https://blog.infinispan.org/2018/03/accessing-infinispan-inside-docker-for.html[here].
You won't need to do this in production, but for testing/development purposes, if you want to connect to a Infinispan
Server running in a Docker container, create `hotrod-client.properties` file under `src/main/resources/META-INF` folder
in each application and configure `infinispan.client.hotrod.client_intelligence=BASIC`


=== Option 2: Download and run the server
- Download the server from http://downloads.jboss.org/infinispan/10.0.0.Beta2/infinispan-server-10.0.0.Beta2.zip[here]
- Unzip the file 
- Run a standalone server from the installation folder: `./bin/standalone.sh`

== Hogwarts Monitoring
Characters can execute spells, and we want to monitor who is in Hogwarts and performing magic.

- A `Character` has an id, name, biography and type (other, student, teacher, muggle).
- A `Spell` has an id, name and description.
- A `Spell` is performed by a character. This character may or may not be at Hogwarts.

=== Data loading
`DataLoader` class loads characters and spells in two separate stores.
This is done at startup time

=== Magic is going on
link:src/main/java/org/infinispan/hp/service/HogwartsMagicCreator.java[Hogwarts Magic Creator] is going to emulate
characters performing some magic. It will randomly pick a character and a spell to perform (if they can)!
Characters in Hogwarts are teachers or students.

TIP: To disable this service, set `create.magic` property to `false` in the `application.properties`.

=== Search
link:src/main/java/org/infinispan/hp/CharactersResource.java[A simple REST service] is available to query
characters by id or perform a full-text search of the name or the biography.

=== Magic Socket
link:src/main/java/org/infinispan/hp/HogwartsMagicWebSocket.java[A socket] that performs a Continuous Query making it possible to
monitor which characters in Hogwarts are currently performing magic.
The continuous query does not have to go to the server and it is all stored in the client application itself. http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#query_continuous[Read more about these queries in the official Infinispan documentation].

=== Run Hogwarts Monitoring in dev mode
To run in development mode, just run `mvn clean compile quarkus:dev`. This allows for hot swapping the application, so you can tweak parts of it 
and it will automatically redeploy.

Go to `http://localhost:8081` and monitor the magic!

You will be connected to the monitoring socket. The interface displays some links to display a character by id and
 perform a full-text search.

.Build and run the demo with jar
   mvn clean package
   cd target
   java -jar hogwarts-monitoring-runner.jar

.Build and run the application in native mode
   mvn package -Pnative
   cd target
   ./hogwarts-monitoring-runner

=== Loaded data
Maven copies `hp_characters.csv` and `hp_spells.csv`to the target directory, that's why it's easier to run the executables
from the `target` folder. However you can override these files location at runtime.

.Running the jar
 
   java -jar  -Dcharacters.filename=/my/path/hp_characters.csv -Dspells.filename=/my/path/hp_spells.csv hogwarts-monitoring-runner.jar

.Running the native
   ./hogwarts-monitoring-runner -Dcharacters.filename=/my/path/hp_characters.csv -Dspells.filename=/my/path/hp_spells.csv

## Wizards Magic

THe `wizards-magic` application is a simple web application that allows to curse!

Run this application as explained above. The application will be available in
`http://localhost:8082`

A simple form will be displayed. You can add you name, pick a curse and tell which kind of Wizard you are.
If the Hogwarts monitoring is running, you should be able to see your curse displayed... If you chose to be
a teacher or a student, of course!


== OpenShift

In this part we will be deploying both modules in OpenShift.
We are going to install Infinispan in OpenShift using Operators. To make this possible you need administration rights.
Operators are supported for OpenShift 4 or 3.11.

=== Using MiniShift

A simple way to deploy locally and test, you can use https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[MiniShift].

Important: This tutorial user **VirtualBox**, but this can be changed in the link:/minishift/setup-minishift.sh[setup file]

Once MiniShift is installed

.Run Minishift
   > ./minishift/setup-minishift.sh
   > minishift start

You should be able to access to the console

.The server is accessible via web console
   https://192.168.99.117:8443/console


=== Install Infinispan Cluster

Run `infinispan-cluster.sh`

This file contains all the necessary commands to install the operator and the Infinispan Cluster.

You can access to OpenShift console

=== Build each application

For both applications execute the following steps:

==== Configure infinispan-client.server-list property

The application is going to be deployed in OpenShift, and will connect to the Infinispan Cluster that is available.

Today the `quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list` is a build time property. This means that the current version of
Quarkus does not allow to override the value dynamically. 

Before building the application, change this value so the application will be able to connect to the Infinispan Cluster
once it will be deployed in OpenShift :

   quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=expecto-patronum-infinispan:11222

==== Build each application native, but for docker

   mvn clean package -Pnative -Dnative-image.docker-build=true

==== Deploy the application
You have two options.


*Option 1: Use Docker Registry*

An image of the applications are available in the public docker hub:

.docker images
   karesti/hogwarts-monitoring:tagname
   karesti/wizards-magic:tagname

You can deploy an image from the OpenShift web console.

*Option 2: Use OpenShift build*

.hogwarts-monitoring
   oc new-build --binary --name=-oc-hogwarts-monitoring -l app=oc-hogwarts-monitoring
   oc start-build oc-hogwarts-monitoring --from-dir=. --follow
   oc new-app --image-stream=oc-hogwarts-monitoring:latest

.wizards-magic
   oc new-build --binary --name=-oc-wizards-magic -l app=oc-wizards-magic
   oc start-build oc-wizards-magic --from-dir=. --follow
   oc new-app --image-stream=oc-wizards-magic:latest

You will see that the applications are deployed and the logs can be displayed.

==== Access to the applications with the browser

If you want to access to the interfaces on the browser, you need to expose a service.

   oc expose service oc-hogwarts-monitoring

   oc expose service oc-wizards-magic
