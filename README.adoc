== Harry Potter Quarkus Demo
The main goal of this demo is to showcase how to use Infinispan client with Quarkus.

*Infinispan* features that are being used:

* Create stores dynamically
* Simple get/put operations
* Full-text query
* Continuous query

*Quarkus* features:

* REST web-service
* Web Socket
* Task Scheduling
* Application properties
* Application lifecycle events listeners

The demo is composed by two applications that run independently:

* Hogwarts monitoring
* Wizards magic

Each application has a dedicated section in this documentation

== Before running the demo
Quarkus uses the https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/hotrod_java/hotrod_java.html[Infinispan Remote Client] ("Hot Rod").
You need to have an Infinispan Server running before you run this demo.

=== Option 1: Use Docker
    docker run -it -p 11222:11222 -e USER="admin" -e PASS="password" infinispan/server

IMPORTANT: *Docker for mac users*. There is a known issue to connect with the server using the Hot Rod client.
Blog post https://blog.infinispan.org/2018/03/accessing-infinispan-inside-docker-for.html[here].
You won't need to do this in production, but for testing/development purposes, if you want to connect to a Infinispan
Server running in a Docker container, create `hotrod-client.properties` file under `src/main/resources/META-INF` folder
in each application and configure `infinispan.client.hotrod.client_intelligence=BASIC`


=== Option 2: Download and run the server
- Download the server from https://infinispan.org/download/[here]
- Unzip the file
- Create a user with admin rights from the installation folder: `./bin/cli.sh user create admin -p password`
- Run a standalone server from the installation folder: `./bin/server.sh`

== Hogwarts Monitoring
Characters can execute spells, and we want to monitor who is in Hogwarts and performing magic.

- A `Character` has an id, name, biography and type (other, student, teacher, muggle).
- A `Spell` has an id, name and description.
- A `Spell` is performed by a character. This character may or may not be at Hogwarts.

=== Data loading
`DataLoader` class loads characters and spells in two separate stores.
This is done at startup time

=== Magic is going on
link:hogwarts-monitoring/src/main/java/org/infinispan/hp/service/HogwartsMagicCreator.java[Hogwarts Magic Creator] is going to emulate
characters performing some magic. It will randomly pick a character and a spell to perform (if they can)!
Characters in Hogwarts are teachers or students.

TIP: To disable this service, set `create.magic` property to `false` in the `application.properties`.

=== Search
link:hogwarts-monitoring/src/main/java/org/infinispan/hp/CharactersResource.java[A simple REST service] is available to query
characters by id or perform a full-text search of the name or the biography.

=== Magic Socket
link:hogwarts-monitoring/src/main/java/org/infinispan/hp/HogwartsMagicWebSocket.java[A socket] that performs a Continuous Query making it possible to
monitor which characters in Hogwarts are currently performing magic.
The continuous query does not have to go to the server and it is all stored in the client application itself.
Read more about these queries in the official https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/developing/developing.html#query_continuous[Infinispan documentation].

=== Run Hogwarts Monitoring in dev mode
Change into the `hogwarts-monitoring` directory.
To run in development mode, just run `mvn clean compile quarkus:dev`. This allows for hot swapping the application, so you can tweak parts of it 
and it will automatically redeploy.

Go to http://localhost:8080 and monitor the magic!

You will be connected to the monitoring socket. The interface displays some links to display a character by id and
 perform a full-text search.

.Build and run the demo with jar
   mvn clean package
   cd target
   java -jar hogwarts-monitoring-runner.jar

.Build and run the application in native mode
   mvn package -Pnative
   cd target
   ./hogwarts-monitoring-runner

=== Loaded data
Maven copies `hp_characters.csv` and `hp_spells.csv` to the target directory, that's why it's easier to run the executables
from the `target` folder. However you can override these files location at runtime.

.Running the jar
 
   java -jar  -Dcharacters.filename=/my/path/hp_characters.csv -Dspells.filename=/my/path/hp_spells.csv hogwarts-monitoring-runner.jar

.Running the native
   ./hogwarts-monitoring-runner -Dcharacters.filename=/my/path/hp_characters.csv -Dspells.filename=/my/path/hp_spells.csv

## Wizards Magic

The `wizards-magic` application is a simple web application that allows to put curses on someone!

Run this application as explained above. The application will be available at http://localhost:8082.

A simple form will be displayed. You can add you name, pick a curse and tell which kind of Wizard you are.
If the Hogwarts monitoring is running, you should be able to see your curse displayed... If you chose to be
a teacher or a student, of course!


== Kubernetes

=== Install and start Minikube
```shell
 minikube start --driver=virtualbox --cpus 4 --memory "8192mb"
```
=== Create Kubernetes Secret `sqlstore-credentials`
```shell
kubectl create secret generic clients-credentials
--from-literal=db-username=infinispan
--from-literal=db-password=secret
--from-literal=infinispan-username=admin
--from-literal=infinispan-password=secret
```

=== Build and deploy
```shell
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -DskipTests=true
```

=== Install the Infinispan Operator
```shell
curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.19.1/install.sh | bash -s v0.19.1
kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/infinispan.yaml
kubectl get csv -n operators
```

=== Create Infinispan identities secret
```shell
kubectl create secret generic --from-file=identities.yaml connect-secret
```

=== Deploy infinispan server
```shell
kubectl apply -f infinispan.yaml
```
